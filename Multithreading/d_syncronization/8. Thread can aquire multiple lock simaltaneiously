Is Thread can aquire multiple lock simaltaneiously ? : Yes afcourse but
from different object

Example :

    public class X {

        public synchronized void m1(){
        	--> heare thread has lock of 'X' object

        	Y y = new Y();

        	synchronized(y){
        		--> heare thread has lock of 'X' and 'Y' object

        		Z z = new Z();

        		synchronized(z){
        			--> heare thread has lock of 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' object
        		}
        	}
        }
    }
