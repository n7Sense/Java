1. if very few lines of the code required synchronization then it is not recommended
    to decleare entire method as synchronized we have to enclose those few lines of
    the code by using synchronized block.

2. The main advantages of synchronized block over synchronized method is it reduces
	waithing time of thread and improve performence of the system.

3. ho to implement .?

	
	synchronized(this){
		---code--
		---code--
		---code--
	}

	Note : 'this' mean to get lock of current objeect.

4. but if you want to get lock for 'particula' object like 'Book objOfB'

	synchronized(objOfB){
		---code--
		---code--
		---code--
	}

5. how to get 'class' level lock for synchronized block

	synchronized(Display.class){
		---code--
		---code--
		---code--
	}


 6.lock concept applicable Object type and class type but not for primitive hence
 	we cant pass primitive type into synchronized block.
	otherwise it will throws Compile Time Error : Unexpected Type :
 	
 	int x =10;

 	synchronized(x){

 	}

 	Compile Time Error : Unexpected Type : fount int
