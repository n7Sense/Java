1.What is lock.? How to implement Synchronization.?
    Internally synchronization concept in implemented by using lock, every object in java has uUNIQUE LOCK.
    Whenevr we are using synchronized key word then only lock concept will come into the picture

    If a thread wants to execute synchronized method on the given object first it has to get lock of that
    object, once thread got th lock then it is allowed to execute any synchronized method on that object.

    onec method execution complete thread releases lock.

    aquiring and releasing lock internally take's care by JVM and programmer not responsible for this activity

Example:

	public class X {

		synchronized void  m1()

		synchronized void m2()

		void m3()
	}

	main(){

		Thread t1, t2, t3, t4;
		X x = new X();

		x.m1();		t1	- got lock executing the m1() method, 
		x.m2();	  	Not allowed (t2, t3, t4), because t1 already got lock in 'x' object
		x.m3();	 	Allowed any object.

	}

    NOTE: while a thread executing synchronized method the remining thread not allowed to
    execute any synchronized method simaltaneiously on the same object. But remining thread
    are allowed to execute non- synchronized method simaltaneiously.
