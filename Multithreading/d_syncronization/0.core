Synchronisation
=================

    Synchronized is a modifier which is applicable only  for methods and block but not for classess and veriables
    If multiple threads are trying to operate simaltaneiously on same java object then there may be a chance of
    Data In Consistancey problem
    To overcome this problem we should go for synchronized key word if a method or block decleared as synchronized
    then at a time onlu one thread allowed to execute that method or block on the given object, so that Data
    Inconstitancey problem resolved.
