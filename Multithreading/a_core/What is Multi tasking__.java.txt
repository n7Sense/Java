 1. What is Multi Threading  Or What is Multi tasking...?
 
A. MultiTasking :

	Executing several task simaltaneiously is concept of multitasking. There 2 types of multitasking
	a) Process based multitasking
	b) Thread based multitasking
	
	a) Process based multitasking
		Executing several task simaltaneiously where each task(job) is separate independent Program(Process).
		i.e there is no depedency between one process to another.
		Process based multitasking is best sutable at OS level.
		
	b) Thread based multitasking
		Executing several task simaltaneiously where each task(job) is separate independent part of the same
		Program, and each independent part is called a Thread.
		Thread based multitasking is best sutable at Programatic level.
		
B. Advantages of MultiTasking
		Whether it is Thread based or Process, the main objective of the multitasking is
		To reduce Idle time of the processor and to reduce reduce response time of the processor and improve
		performence.
	
C. Where We should go for Multithreading. Or whta is the main importent application area of Multithreading.?
	To develop Multi media graphics.
	To develop video games.

D. Wheere we can use Multithreading concept.
	To develop Web Server and Application Server (eg Tomcat Server have default 60 threads).
	
	When compared with the old languages developing multithreaded application in java is very
	easy becasuse java provide inbuild support for multithreading with rich API like
	Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup.
