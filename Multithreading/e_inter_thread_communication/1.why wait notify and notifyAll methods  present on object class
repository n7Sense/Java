wait(), notify() and notifyAll() pesent in Object class but not in thread class
because thread can call this method on any 'Java Object'

To call wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods on any object, thread should
br owner of that object i.e that thread should has lock of that object that is
the thread should be inside synchronized area.

Hence we can call wait, notify, and notifyAll only from synchronized area
otherwise we will get 
RunTime Exception :  IllegalMonitorStateException : if the current thread is not
the owner of the object's monitor.
