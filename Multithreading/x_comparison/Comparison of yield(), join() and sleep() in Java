Comparison table yield(), join(), sleep()

Yield():

    1.  If a thread wants to pass its execution to give chance to remaining threads
        of same priority then we should go for yield()
    2.  Is it overloaded?   NO
    3.  Is it final?	    NO
    4.  Is it throws?	    NO
    5.  Is it native?	    YES
    6.  Is it static?       Yes

Join():

    1.  If a thread wants to wait until completing of some other thread then we should go for join()
    2.  Is it overloaded?   Yes
    3.  Is it final?	    Yes
    4.  Is it throws?	    Yes
    5.  Is it native?	    No
    6.  Is it static?       No

     1.  If a thread does not want to perform any operation for a particular amount of time, then it goes for sleep()

     3.  Is it final?	     No
     4.  Is it throws?	     Yes
     5.  Is it native?	     sleep(long milis) is native and sleep(long milis, int nano) is non native
     6.  Is it static?       Yes
