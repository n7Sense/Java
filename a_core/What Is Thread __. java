Thread
========
	A thread is a Flow of an Execution. for every thread a seprate independent Job is there.
	
Example :

		public class MyThread extends Thread{
			//executed by child Thread
			@Override
			public void run(){
			
			//In this area is called "Job Of Thread"
				for (int i=0; i<5; i++){
					S.o.pln("Child Thread");
				}
				
			}
		}
		
		public class ThreadDemo{
			
			public static void main(String args[]){
				MyThread mt = new MyThread();
				mt.start();
			}
		}
		
	
Thread Scheduler
================
	It is part of JVM, it is responsible to schedule Thtread i.e if multiple threads are waiting
	to get the chance of execution then in which order threads will be executed is desided by thread
	scheduler.
	We can't except exact algorithm followed by thread schedule it varied from Jvm to jvm hence
	we cant except thread execution order and exact output, hence whenever comes to multithreading there
	is no guirenty for exact output but we can provide several possible output.
